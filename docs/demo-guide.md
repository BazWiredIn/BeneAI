## Demo Script (7 Minutes)

### Slide 1: Hook (30 seconds)

**[Show title slide with BeneAI logo]**

> "Have you ever left a Zoom call and thought, 'I wish I'd said that differently'? Or realized you were talking way too fast during your investor pitch?
>
> Hi, I'm [Name], and this is BeneAI - your AI coach for high-stakes video calls."

**Key Message:** We've all had bad video call experiences. BeneAI solves this.

---

### Slide 2: The Problem (45 seconds)

**[Show statistics slide]**

> "Here's the thing:
> - 80% of professionals now do critical meetings over video
> - Sales calls, job interviews, investor pitches - all on Zoom
> - But unlike in-person, you can't read the room as easily
> - And you have ZERO feedback on how you're coming across
>
> What if you had a coach watching every call, giving you real-time advice?"

**Key Stats:**
- $1.5 trillion lost annually due to poor communication (cite source)
- 70% of remote workers say communication is harder on video
- Average exec does 12+ video calls per week

---

### Slide 3: The Solution (30 seconds)

**[Show product screenshot]**

> "That's exactly what BeneAI does.
>
> It's a Chrome extension that analyzes your facial expressions, speech patterns, and emotional tone in real-time, then gives you coaching advice as you speak.
>
> Let me show you."

**[Transition to live demo]**

---

### Slide 4-5: Live Demo (3-4 minutes)

#### Setup (15 seconds)

> "I'm going to join a Google Meet call with my teammate right now.
> Watch the corner of my screen - that's where BeneAI will appear."

**[Share screen, open Google Meet]**
**[Join call with teammate]**
**[Point out extension icon in browser toolbar]**

#### Demo Part 1: Emotion Detection (60 seconds)

> "First, BeneAI is analyzing my facial expressions using MediaPipe.
> Watch what happens when I look concerned..."

**[Make worried expression, frown]**
**[Point to overlay showing emotion state]**

> "See that? It detected I look concerned. And now..."
> **[Read advice that appears]**
> "It's suggesting I take a breath and project confidence. That's real-time coaching."

**[Smile naturally]**

> "And when I smile, it recognizes positive emotion. The AI adapts instantly."

#### Demo Part 2: Speech Pacing (90 seconds)

> "Now let me talk about our roadmap for this product. So we're planning to expand to mobile platforms and add multi-person tracking and integrate with calendar apps and also build custom coaching profiles..."

**[Speak rapidly without pauses]**
**[Point to pacing advice appearing]**

> "See that? BeneAI just told me I'm speaking at 195 words per minute and suggested I slow down to 140.
> It's analyzing my speech rate in real-time using the Web Speech API."

**[Slow down deliberately]**

> "Like... this... much... better... right?"

**[Show advice updating]**

#### Demo Part 3: Filler Words (60 seconds)

> "Um, so, like, what I'm trying to say is, uh, we built this entire system in, um, just one week, and, like, it actually works."

**[Use excessive filler words intentionally]**
**[Point to filler word counter]**

> "There! It counted 7 filler words and suggested I pause instead of saying 'um.'
> This is the kind of feedback that makes you a better communicator."

#### Demo Part 4: Streaming Advice (30 seconds)

> "Notice how the advice appears word by word? That's because we're streaming responses from GPT-4 in real-time.
> The backend processes my video and audio, sends parameters to our API, and GPT-4 generates coaching advice on the fly.
>
> Total latency? Under 500 milliseconds."

**[Point to advice streaming in]**

---

### Slide 6: Technical Architecture (60 seconds)

**[Show architecture diagram]**

> "Here's how it works under the hood:
>
> 1. **Client-side**: Chrome extension captures video/audio
> 2. **Face Analysis**: MediaPipe detects 468 facial landmarks - all in the browser, privacy-first
> 3. **Speech Analysis**: Web Audio and Speech APIs analyze pacing and filler words
> 4. **Backend**: We aggregate these parameters and send to our FastAPI backend on Cloud Run
> 5. **AI Coaching**: GPT-4 Turbo generates personalized advice based on your state
> 6. **Streaming**: Advice streams back via WebSocket in under 500ms
>
> Everything is real-time, nothing is stored. Your video never leaves your browser."

**Key Technical Highlights:**
- Multi-modal AI (vision + audio + language)
- Sub-second latency
- Privacy-first architecture
- Serverless deployment

---

### Slide 7: Market Opportunity (45 seconds)

**[Show market slide]**

> "Who needs this?
> - **Sales teams**: Close more deals with better pitch delivery
> - **Job seekers**: Ace your next video interview
> - **Executives**: Command the room on investor calls
> - **Therapists**: Get feedback on client interactions
> - **Public speakers**: Practice presentations with AI feedback
>
> The remote work market is $450 billion and growing. Communication coaching is a $5 billion industry.
> BeneAI sits right at that intersection."

---

### Slide 8: Future Vision (30 seconds)

**[Show roadmap slide]**

> "We built this in a week for this hackathon. Imagine what's next:
> - Multi-person tracking - coach based on how others react
> - Historical analysis - see your improvement over time
> - Custom coaching - sales vs interviews vs therapy
> - Mobile app - view insights on your phone during calls
> - Team analytics - how's your whole team performing?
>
> This is just the beginning."

---

### Slide 9: Call to Action (15 seconds)

**[Show contact slide]**

> "Want to try it? We have installation instructions right here.
> The extension takes 2 minutes to install.
>
> We're Team BeneAI. Let's make every video call your best call.
>
> Questions?"

---

## Q&A Preparation (2-3 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate is the emotion detection?**
> "For basic emotions like happy, concerned, and surprised, we're seeing 70-80% accuracy using rule-based detection on MediaPipe landmarks. With more training data, we could push that to 90%+."

**Q: What about privacy? Are you recording calls?**
> "Great question. Zero recording. Your video never leaves your browser - we process it locally with MediaPipe. We only send aggregated metrics like 'user looks concerned' or 'speech rate: 180 WPM' to our backend. No video, no audio files, no storage."

**Q: Does this work on all video platforms?**
> "Any WebRTC-based platform - Google Meet, Zoom web app, Microsoft Teams web. Desktop apps are trickier but doable with screen capture."

**Q: What if multiple people are on the call?**
> "Right now, we focus on the user (you). Multi-person tracking is on our roadmap - imagine coaching based on how your audience reacts."

**Q: How much does the OpenAI API cost per call?**
> "About $0.05-0.10 per hour of calling, assuming one advice update every 3 seconds. We're also exploring fine-tuned smaller models to cut costs by 90%."

**Q: Can I customize the coaching style?**
> "Not yet, but that's a key feature. Imagine setting your goal: 'I want to sound more confident' vs 'I want to be more empathetic.' Different advice for different contexts."

**Q: What's the latency in real-world conditions?**
> "We're averaging 400-700ms from capture to advice display. That includes video processing, audio analysis, backend round-trip, and GPT-4 generation. It feels instant."

**Q: How do you prevent the advice from being distracting?**
> "UI/UX is critical. Our overlay is minimalist - just a small corner widget that expands on hover. It's there when you need it, invisible when you don't. We also auto-hide advice after 10 seconds."

**Q: What's your business model?**
> "Freemium: Free tier with basic coaching (5 calls/month). Pro tier ($20/month) for unlimited calls, advanced analytics, and custom coaching. Enterprise tier for teams with admin dashboards."

**Q: Why not use a fine-tuned model instead of GPT-4?**
> "For hackathon, we went with GPT-4 for quality and speed of development. Post-hackathon, we'll fine-tune Llama 3 or similar for 90% cost reduction while maintaining quality."

**Q: Can I use this for in-person presentations?**
> "Interesting idea! Right now it's for video calls, but we could adapt it for in-person with a mobile app watching the speaker."
