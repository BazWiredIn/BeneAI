# Deepgram Integration Complete ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

## Summary

Successfully replaced unreliable Chrome Web Speech API with **Deepgram's professional speech-to-text service**. The system now captures audio chunks in the browser, sends them to the backend, and gets accurate transcriptions with word-level timestamps.

---

## What Was Changed

### Problem: Web Speech API Unreliable
- ‚ùå Constant "network" errors despite good connectivity
- ‚ùå Chrome-dependent, fails randomly
- ‚ùå No control over reliability
- ‚ùå No word-level timestamps

### Solution: Deepgram Integration
- ‚úÖ Professional-grade speech-to-text
- ‚úÖ 95%+ accuracy
- ‚úÖ Word-level timestamps (precise!)
- ‚úÖ Automatic punctuation
- ‚úÖ Backend-controlled (reliable)
- ‚úÖ $0.0043/minute (very affordable)

## Configuration Required

### Step 1: Get Deepgram API Key

1. Go to https://deepgram.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Get $200 free credit (lasts 45,000 minutes!)
4. Copy your API key from dashboard

### Step 2: Update .env File

Edit `backend/.env`:

```bash
# Deepgram Configuration (Speech-to-Text)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=61e7d384db8ca458f128b62aaa8fd2e5b455051c  # Replace this!
DEEPGRAM_MODEL=nova-2
DEEPGRAM_LANGUAGE=en-US
DEEPGRAM_PUNCTUATE=true
DEEPGRAM_UTTERANCES=true
DEEPGRAM_INTERIM_RESULTS=false
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend

```bash
# Kill old backend
pkill -f "python main.py"

# Start new backend
python main.py > backend.log 2>&1 &
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/bazilahmad/BeneAI/backend
python main.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
INFO: Deepgram client initialized successfully
INFO: Started server process
INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

### 2. Open Frontend
```
http://localhost:8080
```

**Hard refresh to clear cache:** `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 3. Start Session and Speak

1. Click **Start** button
2. Grant microphone permission (if prompted)
3. **Speak clearly:** "We have strong revenue growth and excellent market traction"
4. Watch the console (F12)

**Expected in browser console:**
```
‚úì [BeneAI] Audio capture initialized
‚úì [BeneAI] Audio chunk sent: #1 (15234 bytes, 2.0s)
‚úì [BeneAI] Audio chunk sent: #2 (14892 bytes, 2.0s)
üìä [timestamp] Audio chunk sent: {"chunk":1, "size":15234, ...}
```

### 4. Check Backend Logs

**Expected in backend.log:**
```
INFO: Transcribing audio chunk #1 for {client_id} (2.0s)
INFO: Transcribed 8 words from {client_id}: "We have strong revenue growth and excellent market"
INFO: Transcribed 9 words from {client_id}: "traction making this our best quarter yet"
INFO: Interval complete for {client_id}: evaluative, 8 words  ‚Üê NOT 0!!!
```

### 5. Stop and Check Session File

```bash
# View latest session
cat session_data.json | jq '.intervals[0:3]'
```

**Expected output:**
```json
[
  {
    "interval_number": 1,
    "investor_state": "evaluative",
    "words": ["We", "have", "strong", "revenue"],
    "full_text": "We have strong revenue",
    "frames_count": 2
  },
  {
    "interval_number": 2,
    "words": ["growth", "and", "excellent"],
    "full_text": "growth and excellent"
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Deepgram client not initialized"

**Cause:** API key not set or invalid

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep DEEPGRAM_API_KEY

# Should NOT be:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY_HERE

# Should be:
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=abc123...  # Your actual key
```

### Issue: "No transcription for chunk" in logs

**Possible causes:**
1. **Silence** - No speech in that 2-second chunk (NORMAL)
2. **Audio format issue** - Check browser supports WebM
3. **Microphone permission** - Grant in browser settings

**Check:**
```bash
# Look for audio chunks being received
grep "Transcribing audio chunk" backend.log

# If you see these, Deepgram is working
# "No transcription" just means silence in that chunk
```

### Issue: Frontend shows "Failed to initialize audio capture"

**Cause:** Microphone permission denied or not available

**Fix:**
1. Chrome ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
2. Allow http://localhost:8080
3. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Still showing 0 words after speaking

**Debug steps:**
```bash
# 1. Check audio chunks are being sent (browser console)
Look for: "Audio chunk sent: #1..."

# 2. Check backend receives chunks
grep "audio_chunk" backend.log

# 3. Check Deepgram transcribes
grep "Transcribed" backend.log

# 4. Check words added to intervals
grep "Interval complete" backend.log
```

- Remove old `audio-analyzer.js` code (Web Speech API)
- Add real-time transcription display in UI
- Implement filler word detection from Deepgram data
- Add speech rate calculation from word timestamps

---

## Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

‚úÖ Browser console shows: "Audio chunk sent: #1..."
‚úÖ Backend logs show: "Transcribed 8 words from {client_id}..."
‚úÖ Intervals show: `"words": ["We", "have", "strong"]`
‚úÖ Session JSON has full transcripts
‚úÖ **WPM > 0** in UI (calculated from word count)

**Current status:**
- ‚ùå 0 words (before)
- ‚úÖ Actual transcripts (after - once you add API key)

---

## Support

**If you encounter issues:**

1. Check backend.log for errors
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify Deep gram API key is set correctly
4. Test with simple phrase: "Hello world"
5. Check that microphone permission is granted

**Common first-time issues:**
- Forgot to add API key ‚Üí Update .env
- Forgot to restart backend ‚Üí `pkill -f python && python main.py`
- Browser cache ‚Üí Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

---

## Conclusion

The system is now ready for reliable speech-to-text! Once you add your Deepgram API key and restart the backend, audio will be transcribed accurately with word-level timestamps, and all intervals will show the actual words spoken.

**No more 0 words!** üéâ
